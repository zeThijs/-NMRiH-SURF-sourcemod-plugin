**Automatically enables surf mode on maps with suffic surf_* . **

The following ConVars may be used:
- sm_surf_message "Server entry message"
  
  
To manually enable surf mode:
- in chat:    !surf       
- in console: sm_surf
  
  
To manually disable surf mode:
- in chat:    !surfoff       
- in console: sm_surfoff
  
  
Just felt like making this simple plugin to have some fun with friends. I hope someone else has some use to it.
Feel free to use/edit the plugin / code in anyway you want.
